## STRAY Simulation platform for radiology systems



### Features


- Offers a high degree of flexibility, allowing any value in system parameters: source-to-object distance, detector-to-object distance, detector misalignment, projection size, volume size.
- Fast multicore and GPU implementation allowing automatic HW resource management. Allows handling 2K resolution volumes on a 32 GB RAM PC. Implementation has been accelerated and optimized, reaching a utilization rate of 95% of the computer's hardware resources (both CPU and GPU). 
- Implementation of dynamic partitioning of the input data. This feature allows the application to run on a multitude of devices and systems.
- Portable implementation as it is possible to run it on both Windows and Linux based systems. 
- Includes the following default configurations: circular CT, helical CT, extended field of view and two tomosynthesis configurations.
